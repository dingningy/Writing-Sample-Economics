# Writing Samples (Economics)

## :writing_hand: Repository Introduction
Though my research primarily focuses on consumer behavior, I am attracted by the economic research a lot, and I belive the intersection of consumer behavior and micro-econ is beautiful. I love topics such as prospect theory and game theory, and I have a deep interest in behavioral economics, development economics, and labor economics. Apart from taking classes in micro and macro economics, I participated in the class of The Economics of Inequality, Discrimination, Poverty, and Exploitation in the summer school at the University of Cambridge. This repository includes two papers from this course. 

**1. The Great Gatsby Curve and Transgenerational Income Inequality**
- [View the paper](./Econ%201_Great%20Gatsby%20Curve.pdf)
This research first reviews the Great Gatsby curve’s theoretical framework, which is followed 
by statistical data and explanatory models (i.e., causal factors). Then, it applies the Great 
Gatsby curve by illustrating the “Democratic inequality” paradox in the United States. Lastly, 
it critically draws conclusions and provides general recommendations for existing policies.  

**2. Forced Labor**
- [View the paper](./Econ%202_Forced%20Labor.pdf)
This research 
first reviews the definition of forced labor, followed by statistical data, cross-industry 
comparison, and cause-effect analysis. Then, it illustrates forced labor in the global supply 
chains of the fashion industry using the example of China’s Xinjiang cotton. Finally, it draws 
conclusions about the forced labor concept with recommendations on policy actions.
