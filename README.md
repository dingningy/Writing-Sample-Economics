# Writing Samples (Economics)

## :writing_hand: Repository Introduction
Though my research primarily focuses on consumer behavior, I am attracted by the economic research a lot, and I belive the intersection of consumer behavior and micro-econ is beautiful. I love topics such as prospect theory and game theory, and I have a deep interest in behavioral economics, development economics, and labor economics. Apart from taking classes in micro and macro economics, I participated in the class of The Economics of Inequality, Discrimination, Poverty, and Exploitation in the summer school at the University of Cambridge. This repository includes two papers from this course. 

**1. The Great Gatsby Curve and Transgenerational Income Inequality**
- [View the paper](./Econ 1_Great%20Gatsby%20Curve.pdf)
This research first reviews the Great Gatsby curve’s theoretical framework, which is followed 
by statistical data and explanatory models (i.e., causal factors). Then, it applies the Great 
Gatsby curve by illustrating the “Democratic inequality” paradox in the United States. Lastly, 
it critically draws conclusions and provides general recommendations for existing policies.
